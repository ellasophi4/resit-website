                    <h3>Implementing CARP principles in my work – Pick Your Own Pumpkins Task:</h3>
                    <body>
                        Outlined in Robin Williams book “The Non-Designers Design Book”, the CARP principles are as follows:
                        C = Contrast; it can refer to contrast in the forms of colour, font weights, type of font etc.
                        A = Alignment; items in design should be aligned together for both ease and aesthetics.
                        R = Repetition, repetition should be used to ensure a cohesive design, this could be through colour, font,
                         layouts etc.
                        P = Proximity; similar items should be grouped together to show their similarity and used
                         to draw the eye to specific information in the intended order.
                        
                        In my reimagination of the PYO pumpkins poster I used contrast in a few different ways. Knowing I’d
                         likely want to be using some orange in the poster due to its theme I quickly decided on a pale blue background which contrasted the array of orange colours I eventually chose for both my large title and pumpkin shapes. I also opted to use contrast in my font choices – my large title and some highlighted information used a Serif font to draw the eye, compared to other text on the poster which used sans-serif for readability at smaller sizes.
                        For alignment I initially used a rigid grid to separate my text and images, however, after playing around with the offsetting of some items and moving them into a more relaxed grid with items overlapping slightly, I preferred the look and felt it fit the event’s theme as it looked more organic.
                        Repetition is evident throughout my poster. I stuck to using two fonts – one serif, one sans-serif 
                        and repeated them both throughout my work. I also used the same tones of orange in both my title and 
                        images to make the poster look cohesive from a distance. The pumpkin image was also repeated multiple 
                        times in the poster which was intended to create some separation in the sections of the poster.
                        In trying to use the proximity concept well, I began by breaking up the copy into chunks I felt went together. I then created areas of separation to house each ‘chunk’. I introduced some movement in the text by choosing abnormal paths whilst ensuring the text remains readable.
                        
                        I think that my poster was successful in creating a product more visually pleasing than the source material
                         and I am happy with the colour scheme and fonts chosen. I was happy to have an opportunity to experiment with shapes in order to enhance my design.
                        I think opportunities to enhance my work would include reconfiguring my bulky copy in the bottom left and experimenting with different flows to more closely guide the viewer to information in a specific order.
