                    <h3>Implementing CARP principles in my work – Pick Your Own Pumpkins Task:</h3>
                    <body>
                        Outlined in Robin Williams book “The Non-Designers Design Book”, the CARP principles are as follows:<br>
                        C = Contrast; it can refer to contrast in the forms of colour, font weights, type of font etc.<br>
                        A = Alignment; items in design should be aligned together for both ease and aesthetics.<br>
                        R = Repetition, repetition should be used to ensure a cohesive design, this could be through colour, font,
                         layouts etc.<br>
                        P = Proximity; similar items should be grouped together to show their similarity and used
                         to draw the eye to specific information in the intended order.<br>
                        
                        In my reimagination of the PYO pumpkins poster I used contrast in a few different ways. Knowing I’d
                         likely want to be using some orange in the poster due to its theme I quickly decided on a pale blue background which contrasted the array of orange colours I eventually chose for both my large title and pumpkin shapes. I also opted to use contrast in my font choices – my large title and some highlighted information used a Serif font to draw the eye, compared to other text on the poster which used sans-serif for readability at smaller sizes.
                        <br>
                         For alignment I initially used a rigid grid to separate my text and images, however, after playing around with the offsetting of some items and moving them into a more relaxed grid with items overlapping slightly, I preferred the look and felt it fit the event’s theme as it looked more organic.
                        <br>
                         Repetition is evident throughout my poster. I stuck to using two fonts – one serif, one sans-serif 
                        and repeated them both throughout my work. I also used the same tones of orange in both my title and 
                        images to make the poster look cohesive from a distance. The pumpkin image was also repeated multiple 
                        times in the poster which was intended to create some separation in the sections of the poster.
                        <br>
                        In trying to use the proximity concept well, I began by breaking up the copy into chunks I felt went together. I then created areas of separation to house each ‘chunk’. I introduced some movement in the text by choosing abnormal paths whilst ensuring the text remains readable.
                        
                        I think that my poster was successful in creating a product more visually pleasing than the source material
                         and I am happy with the colour scheme and fonts chosen. I was happy to have an opportunity to experiment with shapes in order to enhance my design.
                        I think opportunities to enhance my work would include reconfiguring my bulky copy in the bottom left and experimenting with different flows to more closely guide the viewer to information in a specific order.

                    <h3>Typography Reflections</h3>
                    <body>
                        Axial: For this poster I used the perspective grid to make an axis to hinge my information off of. I enjoy the slight distortion of the lettering and the illusion of floating. I like the layout and think that all of the text is readable.<br>

                        Bilateral: I liked this layout although having all the text towards the centre line of the poster left lots of unused space in each corner. The highlighted text draws your eye first. I think the bulk copy could be made easier to read however the contrast helps.<br>
                        
                        Dilatational: Initially I struggled for ideas for this system however I am pleased with the final outcome. I like the colours I have chosen and think they read well. I opted to not have all of the posters text on a curve as it became overwhelming quickly and hard to read.<br>
                         
                        Random: This poster is slightly ugly however that is what I really enjoy about it. I like to imagine the viewer having to reorientate themselves, randomly. There is a hierarchy set out with the size of fonts and their readability against the background. Although it might not be the most effective poster from a marketing point of view, I like this poster due to the exploration.<br>

                        Grid: I really like this poster – I used the same colour scheme for a few of the posters. The grid system was easy to use but left lots of options for configuration. I settled on this blocky design stretching the bigger text to fit into the colour blocks to highlight the text further.<br>

                        Radial: Although I like the final look of this poster with both colour choice and overall finish I do think that in places it could be improved, maybe by using more of the yellow to differentiate where parts of the blue text bleed into one another. I think it leaves a nice amount of negative space on the poster.<br>

                        Transitional: I found this system the hardest to find an idea for that I liked. The final product is a little underwhelming although I do like the way the text moves with the circle background design. I do feel this poster looks heavier on the right side.<br>

                        Modular: I really like this design due to the use of shape and colour. I think visually it is striking, and I liked the use of the modular system to break up my information easily.<br>
